This project focuses on predicting employee salaries using various machine learning techniques in Python. The goal of the project is to create a model that predicts employee salaries based on factors like age, gender, education level, job title, and years of experience. It makes use of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation processes to ensure that the prediction model performs effectively.

The project is built using two Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate different aspects of the workflow. The first notebook focuses on basic data exploration, cleaning, and training a simple linear regression model for salary prediction. It begins by loading the dataset, which contains information like years of experience and salary. It explores the data, checks for missing values, and handles them by filling with appropriate strategiesâ€”median for numerical values and mode for categorical values. After preprocessing the data, a linear regression model is trained and evaluated, and the model is then used to predict salaries based on test data. Finally, the model's performance is evaluated using metrics like R-squared.

In the second notebook, a more complex model is implemented using Random Forest Regressor to predict the salary. This notebook starts with loading and cleaning the dataset, followed by label encoding of categorical features like gender and education level. It then splits the dataset into training and testing sets. Afterward, the Random Forest Regressor is trained on the data, and performance metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are calculated to evaluate the model's accuracy. Finally, the model's results are visualized by plotting actual vs. predicted salaries. The notebook concludes by saving the trained model using joblib, so it can be reloaded and used for future predictions without retraining.

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine. Install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file using pip install -r requirements.txt. You will need Python 3.x and the listed libraries, including pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and joblib, to run the notebooks.

By running the provided notebooks, you can see how data preprocessing is done, how various machine learning models are trained, and how performance is evaluated. Additionally, the notebooks provide visualizations to better understand the relationship between years of experience and salary. This project serves as a good example of a practical application of machine learning for regression tasks.

Feel free to explore the repository, modify the code, and even contribute to it by making improvements or adding new features. If you'd like to use the model in a real-world application, you can easily load the saved model using joblib and start predicting salaries based on new data.
